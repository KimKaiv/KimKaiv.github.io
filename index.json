We investigate the asset-pricing impacts of eight widely cited investor-sentiment indicators (one direct, six indirect, one composite), within a unified long-horizon regression framework, predicting real NYSE-index returns over horizon lengths of 1, 3, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Results reveal that three of the non-composite indicators have consistent predictive power: the Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment (MICS), IPO volume (NIPO), and the dividend premium (PDND). This finding has implications for the widely cited Baker-Wurgler first principal component (SFPC) composite indicator, which extracts information from the full set of six indirect indicators. As the diffusion-index literature shows, this type of wide-net approach is likely to impound idiosyncratic noise into the composite summary indicator, exacerbating forecasting errors. Therefore we create a new `targeted' composite indicator from the first principal component of the three indicators that perform well in long-horizon regressions, i.e. MICS, NIPO, and PDND. The resulting targeted composite indicator outperforms SFPC in a market-returns prediction horse race. Whereas SFPC primarily predicts Equally Weighted Returns (EWR) rather than Value Weighted Returns (VWR), our new sentiment indicator performs better than SFPC in predicting both VWR and EWR. This improved performance is due in part to a reduction in overfitting, and in part to incorporation of the direct sentiment indicator MICS.","tags":["investor sentiment","predictability","long-horizon regression","bootstrap","diffusion index","composite index","overfitting","Kim Kaivanto","Peng Zhang"],"title":"Investor Sentiment as a Predictor of Market Returns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kim Kaivanto","Daniel Steel"],"categories":["statistical decision functions","signal detection theory"],"content":"","date":1554073298,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554073298,"objectID":"5b1dbcd62560d8036c91b56769207c4c","permalink":"https://KimKaiv.github.io/publication/adjusting-inferential-thresholds-to-reflect-nonepistemic-values/","publishdate":"2019-10-12T17:18:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/adjusting-inferential-thresholds-to-reflect-nonepistemic-values/","section":"publication","summary":"Many philosophers have challenged the ideal of value-free science on the grounds that social or moral values are relevant to inferential thresholds.

This contrasts with the case of actuarially fair side bets where only one such bet will be undertaken.

There are no current examples of systemic cyber risk crystallising and impacting the real economy but this does not prove an absence of risk.

When a multi-leg (\u003e=2) itinerary is most efficient, legs are ideally of equal length. Instrumental to the parsimony of this flight-segmentation benchmark is a new efficiency metric: Fuel-Payload Ratio (FPR). The FPR approach has a one-to-one correspondence with the standard microeconomic cost-curves framework, which avails the standard tools of microeconomic analysis for cost-efficient design-range determination and optimal flight segmentation. This makes it possible to make direct comparisons between (i) technically efficient design-range and flight-segmentation solutions and (ii) their economically efficient counterparts.

Hence, when the new risks and transaction costs become manifest -- as the fintech business models are rolled out across the wider economy -- the consequences may also appear to be new and surprising. The present study represents an effort to get ahead of these developments by delineating risks and transaction costs inherent in distributed-ledger- and smart-contracts-based fintech business models.

Among the IPCC, ICAO, DEFRA, and BrighterPlanet calculation methods, the largest estimate may be up to 4.5 times larger than the smallest. Such heterogeneity -– and ambiguity over the true estimate -– confuses the consumer, undermining the credibility of emissions estimates in general. Consequently, GHG emissions estimates do not currently appear on the front page of flight search-engine results. Even where there are differences between alternative flights’ emissions, this information is unavailable to consumers at the point of choice. When external considerations rule out alternative travel-modes, the relative ranking of flight options’ GHG emissions is sufficient to inform consumers’ decision making. Whereas widespread agreement on a gold standard remains elusive, the present study shows that the principal GHG emissions calculation methods produce consistent rankings within specific route-structure classes. Hence, for many consumers, the flight identified as most GHG efficient is not sensitive to the specific calculation method employed. But unless GHG emissions information is displayed at the point of decision, it cannot enter into consumers’ decision making. A credible and ambiguity-free alternative would thus be to display GHG ranking information on the front page of flight search-engine results.","tags":["greenhouse gas emissions","carbon footprint","scheduled passenger air transport","informed choice","decision making","behavior","policy","Peng Zhang","Kim Kaivanto"],"title":"Rank-order concordance among conflicting emissions estimates for informing flight choice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kim Kaivanto"],"categories":["behavioural decision theory","cybersecurity"],"content":"","date":1418598074,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1418598074,"objectID":"cbdae3355a3b718097b229a2f3f1596e","permalink":"https://KimKaiv.github.io/publication/the-effect-of-decentralized-behavioral-decision-making-on-system-level-risk/","publishdate":"2019-10-12T18:52:14+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/the-effect-of-decentralized-behavioral-decision-making-on-system-level-risk/","section":"publication","summary":"Certain classes of system-level risk depend partly on decentralized lay decision making. For instance, an organization's network security risk depends partly on its employees' responses to phishing attacks. On a larger scale, the risk within a financial system depends partly on households' responses to mortgage sales pitches. Behavioral economics shows that lay decision makers typically depart in systematic ways from the normative rationality of Expected Utility (EU), and instead display heuristics and biases as captured in the more descriptively accurate Prospect Theory (PT). In turn psychological studies show that successful deception ploys eschew direct logical argumentation and instead employ peripheral-route persuasion, manipulation of visceral emotions, urgency, and familiar contextual cues. The detection of phishing emails and inappropriate mortgage contracts may be framed as a binary classification task. Signal Detection Theory (SDT) offers the standard normative solution, formulated as an optimal cutoff threshold, for distinguishing between good/bad emails or mortgages. In this paper we extend SDT behaviorally by re-deriving the optimal cutoff threshold under PT. Furthermore we incorporate the psychology of deception into determination of SDT's discriminability parameter. With the neo-additive probability weighting function, the optimal cutoff threshold under PT is rendered unique under well-behaved sampling distributions, tractable in computation, and transparent in interpretation. The PT-based cutoff threshold is (i) independent of loss aversion and (ii) more conservative than the classical SDT cutoff threshold. Independently of any possible misalignment between individual-level and system-level misclassification costs, decentralized behavioral decision makers are biased toward under-detection, and system-level risk is consequently greater than in analyses predicated upon normative rationality.","tags":["prospect theory","signal detection theory","spear phishing","system-level risk","psychology of deception","security","cybersecurity","Kim Kaivanto"],"title":"The Effect of Decentralized Behavioral Decision Making on System-Level Risk","type":"publication"}]
